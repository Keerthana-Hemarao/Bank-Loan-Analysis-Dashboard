## Project Overview

The Bank Loan Dashboard provides a three-page analytics experience:

1. **Summary Page** – Overall loan portfolio performance  
2. **Overview Page** – Trends and customer segmentation  
3. **Details Page** – Record-level loan and borrower insights  

With **38.6K total loan applications**, **$435.8M funded**, and **$473.1M received**, the analysis highlights high-performing customer groups along with risk segments contributing to loan losses.

### **4. Borrower Segmentation Highlights**

#### **Monthly Trend**

Job stability strongly influences loan approval and repayment behavior.

#### **Home Ownership**
